Some time ago I decided to built a voron 3d-printer myself. The voron 3d-printers are designed by a great community with lots of experience and dedication. While their larger models are most popular, I decided to go with the smallest one - the V0 with a build volume of `120mm x 120mm x 120mm` for portability reasons.

When doing prototyping for some hobby project or with friends I often wished to had my beloved voron v0.2 closeby. But it's too fragile to transport just like that; The hours invested in building and calibrating it might go to waste if it takes damage while taking it outside my homelab. This is why it needed a strong and sturdy case to keep it safe for travels. A flightcase was needed.
