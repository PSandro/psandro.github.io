My name is Sandro Pischinger and my passion is technology: Servers, Computers, Coding, DevOps, IT-Security, Cables, Buttons. These words are music to my ears! My personal experience and interest in technology has grown for over a decade now. In addition to just using technology, I early began creating and modifying stuff, assembling computers and wiring LAN-networks. Having gained a decent knowledge about hardware over the years, I soon started working with software by contributing to OpenSource-Software, creating websites and handy Bash or Python scripts. I love coding. Especially when working in a team, at coding camps or everywhere else where tech enthusiasts and creative minds work together. Furthermore I have an insatiable interest in learning new things and working with the latest technology!
